# Contribute 🙏

The repository [lhapaipai/symfony-vite-dev](https://github.com/lhapaipai/symfony-vite-dev) brings together in a folder all the tools to participate in development.
You will have access to the Symfony bundle and the Vite plugin in the `src` folder. The `playground` folder groups together test environments to cover all use cases.

npm dependencies are managed at the root in order to have the same dependencies for all examples (and a single node_modules folder).
the composer examples dependencies are installed in each folder `playground/basic`, `playground/legacy`, etc... because I haven't found a clean way to do that. (the `vendor` folder also contains the path to the autoloads specific to each example so I could not share this folder. if you have another solution let me know)
